**Added:**

* ``_get_normalized_pstring_quote`` returns a consistent set of prefixes, and the quote, for all path-string variants e.g. inputs ``pr'`` and ``rp'`` both produce the tuple ``("pr", "'")``. This function is used by ``xonsh.completers.complete_path`` and ``xonsh.completers._path_from_partial_string``.

**Changed:**

* Remove ``p``, ``rp`` and ``pr`` prefix from partial p-string used in ``xonsh.completers._path_from_partial_string``, such that ``ast.literal_eval`` does not raise ``SyntaxError``. ``pr`` and ``rp`` strings are now treated internally as raw strings, but the p-string quote is correctly returned.
* Increment the prefix length when the prefix input to ``xonsh.completers.complete_path`` is a p-string. This preserves the length of the prefix for path-string variants.
